<name>Airstream Classic</name>
<p>Perhaps no other RV nameplate is as iconic and revered as Airstream. The sleek aluminum travel trailers were first produced in 1936 and are some of the most luxurious travel trailers on the market. The most modern Airstream produced today is the 33-foot 2019 Classic, built for longer trips or full-time living.</p>
<p>Outside, the trailer preserves the classic Airstream aluminum shell. Inside, there are sleek furnishings, Corian counters, soft leather, and LED lighting. The Classic sleeps up to five and has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000, so you'll need a heavy-duty half-ton truck with a tow package to haul this beast.</p>
