<p>PClass C motor homes are some of the most versatile RVs. Most are based on heavy-duty cut-away van chassis, which means the living accommodations can be quite a bit larger than those of a Class B motor home (which keeps the living accommodations within the stock body of the van).</p>
<p>Thor has introduced the Quantum LF31, based on the bones of a Ford E-450 Super Duty. This monstrously strong chassis is paired to the 6.8-liter Triton V-10 with 420 lb-ft of torque and the ability to tow a whopping 8,000 pounds. The 32'7"-foot-long home has a 84" ceiling, an 11 cubic-foot refrigerator, queen-size bed, dual flat-panel TVs, and dual 11,000-BTU air conditioners.</p>
